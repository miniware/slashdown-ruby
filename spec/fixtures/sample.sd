// This is a comment. It will not be rendered in the output.
// As you can see above, /* */ multiline comments are also supported.

/main .container.mx-auto
  // Any line starting with a `/` is a tag, unless it's a comment.
  // You can add classes and ids to tags via the usual shorthands (e.g. .class #id)
  // You can also add attributes the normal way! (e.g. href="https://example.com" )

  // Anything not starting with a `/` is a child of the previous tag, and will be rendered as markdown
  // Indentation is important! It determines the parent/child relationship of tags.

  # This is a heading. It will be rendered as an <h1> tag.

  It's the child of the section element above it.

  / .grid.grid-col-2
    data-foo="bar"

    This will render as a paragraph.

    And this will render as a paragraph too.

    // An empty tag will be rendered as a <div> tag.
    // And items on the immediate next line after a tag, if indented, will be parsed as attributes.

  // Items at the same indent level become siblings.
  /footer
    .flex.justify-between

    // You can use `=` with the last item in a block, rendering the rest as a literal text child.
